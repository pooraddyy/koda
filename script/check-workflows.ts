/**
 * Guards the deliberately small terminal-only CI surface.
 *
 * A workflow can publish packages, consume credentials, or execute code in a
 * privileged runner. The allowlist below makes every added or removed workflow
 * an explicit review decision.
 *
 * Only runnable workflows are checked (`.yml` / `.yaml`). Files under
 * `.github/workflows/disabled/` files cannot run and are not tracked here.
 *
 * To accept a new workflow: add its filename to `active`.
 * To drop one: remove its filename from the list.
